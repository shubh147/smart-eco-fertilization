## ðŸ“„ Abstract

The application of fertilizers is often beyond the precise control of farmers. To optimize crop yield and minimize fertilizer loss, farmers require accurate and timely guidance. One key factor influencing nutrient loss is rainfall, which can both support and hinder fertilizer effectiveness. While moderate rainfall aids in dissolving dry fertilizer and moving nutrients to the root zone, excessive rainfall may lead to nutrient leaching and runoffâ€”especially of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), manganese (Mn), and boron (B).

This project leverages an enhanced **Random Forest algorithm** based on **time-series data** to generate nutrient recommendations. By analyzing rainfall patterns and crop fertility data, the system forecasts the appropriate quantity of nutrients required for different crops. This method not only improves soil fertility but also helps reduce nutrient leaching and runoff, promoting sustainable agriculture.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. **Install** all required modules listed above.

2. **Navigate** to the following directory:

   ```bash
   Eco-Fertilization/Code/app/
   ```

3. **Run the Application:**

   * **Ubuntu / macOS:**

     ```bash
     python3 app.py
     ```
   * **Windows:**

     * Option 1: Double-click `app.py`
